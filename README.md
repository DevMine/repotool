`repotool` is a command line tool that aggregates source code repositories
metadata (such as VCS type, commits and so on) and produces JSON objects out of
it.  It is also able to store repository information into a database.

A repository contains a list of commits that may contain, if you enable this
option, a list of deltas. A delta contains information about a file
touched by a commit. It may also contain patches if specified via an option.

Currently, only [git](http://git-scm.com/) is supported.

Below is an example of the data produced, without commit deltas and patches:

```
{
  "name": "repotool",
  "vcs": "git",
  "clone_url": "https://github.com/DevMine/repotool.git",
  "clone_path": "/home/robin/Hacking/repotool",
  "default_branch": "master",
  "commits": [
    {
      "vcs_id": "df55def5e6185447c6bd360ec1144a847d73b986",
      "message": "repotool: Add possibility to insert commit diff deltas into the db.\n\nFor this purpose, create a new 'commit_diff_deltas' table.\n",
      "author": {
        "name": "Robin Hahling",
        "email": "robin.hahling@gw-computing.net"
      },
      "committer": {
        "name": "Robin Hahling",
        "email": "robin.hahling@gw-computing.net"
      },
      "author_date": "2015-01-14T18:12:47+01:00",
      "commit_date": "2015-01-14T18:12:47+01:00",
      "file_changed_count": 2,
      "insertions_count": 89,
      "deletions_count": 2
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

And with deltas enabled (without patches):

```
{
  "name": "repotool",
  "vcs": "git",
  "clone_url": "https://github.com/DevMine/repotool.git",
  "clone_path": "/home/robin/Hacking/repotool",
  "default_branch": "master",
  "commits": [
    {
      "vcs_id": "863f9ed113f06829359d0fd4040ae4a6b5c1cf5e",
      "message": "tools/batch: Use a channel to create a pool of tasks for goroutines.\n\nUse a channel on which each tasks (ie call to repotool) is added.\nThis allows to have goroutines picking up tasks from the channel as soon\nas they are done.

      "author": {
        "name": "Robin Hahling",
        "email": "robin.hahling@gw-computing.net"
      },
      "committer": {
        "name": "Robin Hahling",
        "email": "robin.hahling@gw-computing.net"
      },
      "author_date": "2015-01-13T15:24:40+01:00",
      "commit_date": "2015-01-13T15:24:40+01:00",
      "diff_delta": [
        {
          "status": "modified",
          "binary": false,
          "old_file_path": "tools/batch.go",
          "new_file_path": "tools/batch.go"
        }
      ],
      "file_changed_count": 1,
      "insertions_count": 25,
      "deletions_count": 23
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

And you can even include patches:

```

}
```

## Installation

`repotool` depends on [git2go](https://github.com/libgit2/git2go), which is a
[Go](http://golang.org/) binding to [libgit2](https://libgit2.github.com/), a C
library that implements `git` core methods. Hence, you need `libgit2` installed
on your system unless you statically compile `libgit2` into `git2go`.

If the requirements are met, installing `repotool` is as simple as running this
command in a terminal (assuming [Go](http://golang.org/) is installed):

    go get github.com/DevMine/repotool

Or you can download a binary for your platform from the DevMine project's
[downloads page](http://devmine.ch/downloads).

## Usage

`repotool` produces JSON, provided that you feed it with a path to a source code
repository managed by a VCS which can be either in the form of a directory or a
tar archive. By default, informative messages are outputted to `stderr` whereas
JSON is outputted to `stdout`. Example usage:

    repotool ~/Code/myawesomeproject > myawesomeproject.json

To insert data into the PostgreSQL database, you need to provide a configuration
file in argument. Simply copy `repotool.conf.sample` to `repotool.conf` and
adjust database connection information. See this
[README.md](https://github.com/DevMine/repotool/blob/master/db/README.md) for
more information about the database schema. Example usage:

    repotool -json=false -db -c repotool.conf ~/Code/myawesomeproject

With the configuration file, you can also tell `repotool` to output commit
deltas and commits patches (the latter works only if you enable commit deltas,
quite logically). Simply set the `commit_deltas` and, eventually,
`commit_patches`, to `true`. Be careful with the `commit_patches` option as this
may rapidly produce a lot of data. Also note that if you plan on inserting data
into a database, patches are not going to be inserted, whether you set
`commit_patches` to `true` or not.

As `libgit2` does not support reading information directly from a tar archive,
when given a git repository as a tar archive, `repotool` will extract part of
the archive into a temporary location. You can specify where using `tmp_dir`
in the configuration file. We advise specifying a path to a ramdisk for
increased performance and reduced main storage I/Os. When using a ramdisk with
limited capacity, you shall specify the largest size for a tar archive to be
extracted in `tmp_dir` using the `tmp_dir_file_size_limit` option. Every tar
archive larger than this size will be extracted in its storage location instead.

If you plan on batch processing multiple repositories, see
[batch-repotool.go](https://github.com/DevMine/devmine/blob/master/tools/batch-repotool.go).
It can process repositories concurrently by recursively traversing directories
and calling `repotool`, spawning goroutines in the process.  When using it, bear
in mind that `repotool` is IO and CPU intensive, hence do not spawn too many
goroutines or you might reach the number of open files limit. The number of
goroutines can be adjusted with the `-g` parameter.  Using about the same number
of goroutines as the number of cpu cores should be a reasonable choice.
